Basic Usage
===========

The Trix-Editor toolbar is not customiziable and kept very simple by design.
It is by default activated for the standard TYPO3 content elements,
which use a rich text editor for specific fields (e.g. bodytext).
How the editor toolbar looks and what is available will depend on the
currently used configuration.

For information about working with content elements, see the section
:ref:`t3editors:content-editing` and :ref:`t3editors:rte` in the
"Tutorial for Editors".


Checkout online demo
====================

If you want to checkout Trix-Editor before installing you go the official
website where the editor is embedded for you to test. But keep in mind
that the attachment button is not integrated. The official demo:
